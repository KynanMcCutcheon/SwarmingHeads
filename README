This is a web interface for the thinkingheads robotics project.

Github is being used as temporary storage until the client's svn server can be used.

To run the project, simply import the project into Eclipse (assuming the PyDev plugin is already installed).

The project has been marked as a 'django' project, so simply pressing 'run' in Eclipse should start up the server.

Start up your favourite web browser (chrome :D) and browse to http://127.0.0.1:8000

Note that you can see Django's output in the Eclipse console
